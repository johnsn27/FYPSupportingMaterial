neg,If you're looking to upload your runs and share with friends and all that greatness that Nike makes is seem to be then don't waste your time.
neg,You're not able to search for your friends sync your email contacts you get errors when syncing in with facebook and twitter.
neg,It syncs fine from your ipod/iphone to itunes but once it gets sent to [...] is when you get screwed.
neg,I've been searching through all the threads and forums and they say they're working on it but over 6 months?
neg,For now I would just skip buying this sensor and just download an app.
neg,Don't believe the hype there is no friendly nike online running community.
neg,Seems like everyone is getting these issues.
mix,Pros: Good features stylish looks ... Cons: This phone is very unreliable.
neg,It is not the carrier's service it is the phone.
neg,My T720 has broke down several times.
neg,It will just turn itself off and will not turn back on.
neg,I don't know from day to day if it will work or not.
neg,I'll never buy another moto
mix,Strengths:looks cool ... Weaknesses:does not work and help menu has no solution.
neg,purchased 12-17-04 for $32.46 at Comp USA in San Bruno Ca. and still cant get it to work properly.
nr,I have the cd installed the icon on the desk top & my cell phone is recognized.
neg,The steps to reach the file transfer are too complex and non exhistent(sp?).I found no company ph number on any of the product literature the web site or yellow pages.com.
neg,The web site says their goal is 100% customer satisfaction and thier tech support page actually suggests that you call them but does not list a phone number.
nr,Their web site even informs you that their office has moved to San Jose-from the santa clara office on their registration card?
neg,Their web site has a section for trouble shooting but this product is not on the list.
neg,I spent 3 days on and off trying to down load phone numbers from my motorola v600 cell phone to my laptop with the ambicom inc usb bluetooth adapter.
neg,No luck & no support.
nr,Anyone that knows a bluetooth usb adapter with a tech support phone number and a descent web page plaese let me know asap.
neg,I will return this one and gladly pay more to get rid of this crap.
nr,carl in san francisco sfnutboy@yahoo.com
mix,Pros: seems to work okay so far Cons: ENCRYPTION KEY IN PLAIN TEXT If you get this product do NOT install the client.
nr,It allows whatever wireless encryption key you're using to be seen in plain text.
nr,Even a limited user account can see the key - anyone sitting at your computer can see it.
nr,Instead install only the driver by browsing the CD to the driver folder.
nr,The instructions say to install the Belkin client but you don't have to.
nr,Only the driver is necessary if used with the Windows client - and the key is masked like it should be.
neg,grainy photos slow jerky movement.
neg,But worse than that is the program NEVER completely uninstalled.
neg,Support has head up rectum - after informing them I uninstalled the program but the program never fully uninstalled I was informed that I must have done something wrong.
neg,Suddenly its my fault that parts of the program remain.
neg,Also NOTE: Software that comes with camera includes BACKWEB - if you are unfamiliar with backweb - it is SPYWARE.
neg,Would NOT recommend this or any other logitech product now.
neg,My real rating is -5 stars.
pos,Pros: this is a very attractive sportband.
pos,It has slot of neat features such as the snap clip for the armband that will male it easy to loosen and tighten the armband on demand.
pos,It also has the cable wrap for your headphone so it won't get into the way while exercising.
neg,Cons: the iPhone 3GS simply won't fit into the pouch.
neg,It is way too tight and appears to have not been designed correctly.
neg,For instance there is a small whole where the earpiece of the phone is suppose to line up.
neg,But regardless of how hard I pushed the iPhone down it won't go any further leaving the top of the phone exposed and earpiece unalligned.
nr,Also around hole where the iPhone goes in there's a thin strip of what appears to be paper that's glued around the mouth is located.
neg,The paper broke the moment you stretch the hole slightly to insert the iPhone.
neg,Very poor quality and design.
neg,No wonder it is getting cheaper by the day.
neg,Highly not recommend it.
neg,This drive is embedded with Western Digital's SmartWare virtual CD that will ALWAYS and FOREVER boot to your Mac computer.
neg,This Virtual CD cannot be disabled unmounted removed eradicated or partitioned away - EVERY!!!!!
nr,"It says so right on WD's website buried in the tech support area"" not on the box where this kind of """"don't-buy-our-product"""" warning belongs."""
neg,Western Digital has decided to embed their Virtual CD Smartware into this drive so that you cannot under any circumstances disable or remove the VCD. It will forever mount this unwanted intrusion to your Mac (Windows is no better apparently) and their website essentially tells you that you can do nothing about it.
neg,Can you tell that I am upset?!?
neg,I own seven other Western Digital hard drives and I will not own this one.
neg,Nor will I buy another in the future out of fear of getting the same results.
neg,"If I were to buy more of these like I had planned"" My desktop would be cluttered with a bunch of meaningless virtual CDs. This intrusion may not annoy Windows users as the Virtual CDs will just clutter up your """"My Computer"""" window; but"" on a Mac this type of unalterable intrusion is beyond unacceptable."
nr,I cannot believe that Western Digital could not see the alienation of every Mac user on the planet from ten miles away on this one.
nr,Western Digital and other drive makers have for a while now put their software install packages onto the external hard drives that they sell; but it has always been just stored on the drive where it can be deleted or is removed when the drive is reformatted - at worst it was on a separate partition that could be removed.
neg,But not with this new version (version 3?) of the My Book Essential Drives where it is embedded into the drive's hardware and cannot be deactivated.
neg,Until Western Digital rethinks their strategy and changes this practice their hard drives should be avoided and boycotted.
nr,(For more information see all of the review on the 1TB version of this drive.)
nr,UPDATE: After returning the Essentials drive I purchased two of Western Digital's Elements External 1TB Hard Drives; Exactly what I needed in the first place...
nr,an external hard drive that is built like a tank and is only what it is supposed to be: a hard drive.
nr,"No ""fancy"" value-added software embedded in the hardware to muck up the works on this drive."
nr,I highly recommend the Western Digital Elements external hard drives for all of your storage needs!
nr,This is my third Bluetooth device in as many years.
nr,I wanted this one because of the portable charger/case.
pos,THAT feature is great!
pos,Makes the headset easy to carry along with cellphone without throwing it in my purse and accidentally having it turn on and call back the last number dialed.
pos,Also it sits nicely on a countertop making the set less easy to lose.
pos,The headset itself easily turns on and off (which sounds like a simple function but wasn't all that easy on my previous two Bluetooths).
neg,Two things I don't like....1)the headset isn't very comfortable for longer calls--my ear starts to hurt if it's in for more than a few minutes.
neg,2)this could be a deal-breaker: In the middle of a conversation even with the cellphone within a few feet of the headset this Bluetooth sometimes disconnects itself and the call has reverted back to the cellphone.
mix,Pros: Fits in shirt pocket - Great Battery Life - Lots of Megapixels ... Cons: No lighting control - terrible auto settings - jitter light always on I bought this camera last week wanting a camera that is small yet does everything; I clearly made a mistake.
neg,It doesn't let you adjust the apperture settings and it always tends to make terrible automatic lighting choices.
nr,Being a person who likes natural light better than a flash I always turned it off.
neg,And thus I wound up with blurry or dark pictures.
neg,After hundreds of pictures and a week of giving it every chance to prove itself I gave up.
nr,Back to Ritz it went.
neg,Even in relatively good lighting conditions it chose horrifying exposure times like 1/6 of a second.
neg,??? In room lighting it even chose 1 second exposures!
neg,It lets you adjust exposure + or -2 but the pics look terrible!
neg,I'm sorry but somebody with a pocket camera is NOT going to be carrying around a tripod to make sure their pics aren't blurry.
neg,I can't use a camera that not only doesn't let me control something as simple as the apperture but it makes bad choices about the lighting.
neg,Even in bright daylight in the shadow of a pine tree the jitter light was on because it was choosing horrible exposure times!
neg,BTW- the jitter light is on about 90% of the time with this camera.
nr,I guess you just have to live with it.
pos,Now even so this is a good camera.
pos,1. The colors are natural and accurate.
pos,2. The pictures are amazingly clear.
pos,3. The auto-focus is next-to-perfect.
pos,4. The battery life is impressive.
pos,I would take in excess of 100 (more even) shots without a recharge fully using the lcd screen.
pos,5. The screen size is a pleasure.
pos,6. It's fast!
pos,Okay my conclusion is this: this camera is a beautifully engineered piece of camera.
pos,It's amazing.
neg,Unfortunately it takes terrible pictures because of something that would have been so easy for Canon to fix.
neg,My pictures did NOT live up to ANY of my expectations.
mix,A good analogy for this camera is this: This camera is like an expensive new Mercades that automatically chooses the brake and acceleration settings for you and doesn't do a good job of it.
nr,Thus you're always cursing about how you'd prefer to apply your own pressure to the brake.
nr,I knew going in that I would have to learn how to use it.
neg,I bought this camera on sale for $399 and hard a really hard time getting good pics out of the camera.
neg,I think out of hundreds of pics I took while I had it I thought 3 were really good.
neg,I bought a telephoto lens to see if that would help but it didn't.
neg,The pictures had no color were not sharp and terrible DOF. I probably could have been able to eventually use it to its fullest potential but I want good photos now.
pos,I've been using the Treo 700W for three months and I absolutely love the set of features it offers.
pos,The wireless sync for email/calendar/contacts/notes with the desktop works perfectly.
pos,The media player wireless internet connection and camera are nice too.
pos,I can create play lists in Windows Media Player on my desktop and when I connect the Treo using the USB cable my play lists are automatically synced to the storage card.
neg,I have two major complaints about this phone.
neg,"First of all"" it's like Windows 95 -- I have to """"reboot"""" it every day -- and I don't have any extra software installed other than what comes with the phone."""
neg,People will frequently tell me they called and got voice mail but my phone did not ring -- when I try to turn on the phone it won't turn on.
neg,I have to remove the battery cover and use the stylus to push the reset button.
neg,If it's going to lock up that much at least they should make the reset button more easily accessible.
neg,Second my favorite feature the voice commands frequently just doesn't work.
pos,When it does work it's incredible -- you push the button on the wired headset and say the right command and you can play music call any one of your contacts and I believe you can do other things I haven't tried yet.
neg,But 80% of the time you push the button and nothing happens.
neg,Very disappointing.
pos,Bento is a smart convenient database for the non-power user.
pos,Within its limitations it's excellent interacting automatically with other apps (like iCal and Address Book) on the Mac. It also simplifies database use in general for those of us intimidated by full FileMaker.
neg,Unfortunately it lacks some capabilities a lot of ordinary Mac users will want - primarily the ability to sync data among multiple Macs. If you keep Bento on your desktop you can't readily sync its data to the same app on your laptop or vice versa.
neg,Makes it tough for use in a mixed environment.
nr,Online discussions have highlighted this shortcoming and we can hope the first revision will overcome this limitation.
neg,This product works ok but potential buyers should be aware of these issues: 1. The auto-orientation feature does not seem to work at all despite me checking that it is enabled and resaving the settings several times.
neg,All of my portrait photos were displayed on their side.
neg,The auto-fit option flattens standard photos quite a lot while the other options leave space on either side of the photo.
nr,I would like to state that I returned the item.
mix,"However I would like to share my thoughts It's a very powerful laptop 2.8GHz4GB RAM 320 HD"" 13"""" There is no problem whatsoever on the spec's BUT the fan always go on when I use the express gate"" with no reason!"
nr,I'm not consuming much CPU nor VGA or RAM so I have no idea why!
neg,it was loud and incomparable.
neg,Also this accrued during normal usage (browsing music) second which was mostly the issue the battery barely last 2 hours!
nr,which was under battery saving mood and very low brightness display bluetooth offand wireless on.
mix,other than that it was good!
nr,I hope this helps
nr,I purchased this clock radio because I thought it was atomic.
neg,I could not get it to set the time automatically.
mix,I has a nice feature in that there are 2 alarms and you can set each one to go off on certain days of the week but once again I was unable to set the days of the week.
neg,What bothered me most about all of this was that there was no customer service number that I could call.
pos,On the plus side there are buttons to program for radio stations and this is done like in the car.
pos,and I think it is pretty.
pos,The webcam works as advertised - with really crappy lighting it still managed to show my face comfortably and worked well with various messaging software.
neg,The bad - on my Windows XP machine with not much software installed and generally well-maintained the software failed to install the drivers properly.
neg,Twice. I called the tech support (paying long distance charges) and after 20 minutes of waiting got through.
neg,It took twenty more minutes for the support rep to get all my information - 20 I kid you not.
neg,And after that she did not even bother to try out anything on my computer.
nr,Her advice straightaway - try to install it in another machine if it does not work call us back so that we can authorize a replacement.
neg,How could you not even try do get it to work on my current machine after spending so much time to get all the information out of me I asked?
nr,Sorry that's the policy.
neg,And I have to call you back on long-distance and then wait forever to the muzak and then hope that you might authorize a replacement I asked.
neg,Yes she replied curtly and hung up.
nr,I had wasted too much time to try to just give up right then so I tried a manual install of the drivers.
mix,"After the installation it has worked like a charm"" but you just have to pray that you never ever have to contact Logitech for their """"support""""."""
nr,I bought this printer to serve a small work group of 4 employees 3 of whom use Macintosh notebooks.
pos,To be fair the MF6595 works flawlessly with all Windows operating systems including Windows 7 Release Candidate.
pos,Windows support includes a wonderful installer that automatically locates all networked printers and installs the correct drivers for them (which is nice since we have 2 other canon printers in our office: IR1023 and a 4080 with H1 attachment).
nr,I don't know why Apple doesn't program a similarly useful installer for Mac hardware.
neg,Getting it up for a Mac can take numerous hours and several phone calls to tech support.
neg,It's pretty frustrating.
pos,The printer itself works great.
pos,It's fast printer high quality black and whites and the scan function is fine if you're not doing too many sheets at once.
mix,A great printer for Windows much less so for Macs. Since I specifically bought it to work with Macs the fact that it doesn't support them well is very frustrating and may lead me to return this printer for a different brand--I hear Brother printers work a lot better with Mac hardware so I might give them a try.
mix,Pros: Durable Quiet ... Cons: Slow Connection I picked this up as a backup device for home machines as well as a home office computer.
pos,Hookup was easy and after dealing with a few issues caused by norton blocking the connection to the drive we are all good to go.
pos,It's cool looking super quiet and a very small form factor.
pos,The software they provide is pretty...
neg,but clunky and slow as hell.
nr,I am using it as a network drive and via a standard 100mbs network.
neg,Now - i used the included software to run a backup of a roughly 300 gig drive that is relatively full and it took almost 2 days for the 1st image to complete...
neg,not that its done it should be very quick but 2 days???
neg,I also noticed a marked slowdown on the machine with the active backup software monitoring in the background.
pos,Love the drive...
pos,This computer is amazing!!
pos,The 4gb of RAM makes it fly when using any program and the hard drive is huge.
pos,There is enough room to store my whole music collection plus many photos.
pos,Also the media keys are very conveinent when listening to music or watching a movie.
pos,The design is pretty cool and it is available in a variety of colors.
pos,"The widescreen makes the screen seem so much bigger than my old laptop which was also 15.4"" but not widescreen."
pos,The WiFi connected to the internet instantly and the bluetooth helped me trannsfer my pictures and videos from my phone onto my computer.
pos,The battery also lasts 4 hours on power saver mode!
neg,My one complaint is that the slot load cd/dvd drive is very noisy.
pos,But that is very minor and the computer is all around a great computer and I would recommend it to everyone who's looking to buy a new computer!!
pos,Pros: You already know the great features.
pos,12X zoom 8MP etc.. no need to repeat.
pos,The Bottom Line: Buy this camera and if you haven't taken a decent picture before this will make you look like a pro!
pos,After researching and comparing this camera (fz30) with others in this price range and higher I decided to buy the Panasonic DMC FZ30. After two weeks of picture takin' and putting the camera through some of it's many features (it has features galore!).
pos,I must say this camera is AWESOME.
pos,Truly fantastic pictures.
pos,Even a little child will take beautiful pictures with this camera if he/she is able to set it to AUTO. But like all electronic equipment (LCD HDTV TV monitors and digcams) you have to adjust the controls (PICT.ADJ) to get the best picture or a picture set to your personal preference; you know-contrast brightness sharpness etc... well the FZ30 has controls that when adjusted properly practically eliminates the so called 'noise' problem.
nr,Remember 'noise' is part of digital technology and all digital cameras have 'noise'- yes DSLR do too it's inherent in the technology (pixels).
nr,Just like all film cameras will show grain noticeable under low lighting conditions with film.
nr,So reducing grain in the best of cameras has to do with the film lighting and the photographer.
nr,It's the same with reducing 'noise' in digital cameras.
nr,If you are getting 'noise' simply set the Pict.Adj to [high noise reduction] use a flash tripod or play with some of the controls and learn how to use the camera and lighting to eliminate noise.
nr,If the picture on a TV is grainy you adjust the sharpness contrast etc. the FZ30 is of the same technology (digital/electronic) and has similar menu's.
nr,And just as a pro photographer takes great pains by using high power lights and accessories like flash tripods etc. in low lighting situations even with his high priced camera high priced lens and thousands of dollars worth of equipment to get a fantastic shot (He doesn't blame the camera just as an artist doesn't blame his brushes for how his pictures turn out)!?
pos,Well simply learning how to adjust a few menu options in the FZ30 and learning when and how to use the appropriate accessories will get you almost the same results with the FZ30 a $500.00 camera as with a $5000. camera.
pos,Yes for the money and features this is the best of the bunch.
pos,It does all you ask of it and more.
nr,So if 'noise' is your only complaint learn how to use the camera controls and remember it won't perform like a $10000 camera with stage lighting camera crew and a professional photographer even if you think it should.
pos,But it does comes close if you know what you're doing!
nr,I run the A/V department in a large hospital.
nr,We have 8 of these units and with the exception of one of them just quit working.
pos,The others have been going strong and they don't use much battery power.
pos,Also the unit is about the size of a TV remote and I believe the large size keeps it from walking away.
neg,Problems Encountered: Had one bad one that I had replaced.
nr,One unit is over three years old.
nr,I have a netgear ethernet network (using the home electrical system).
pos,Set-up took 10 minutes and I didn't need support from Slingbox.
pos,I am shocked how good the picture is even when the broadband is slow.
pos,I have connected on PC's and Mac's and even connected on my Treo (which was amazingly good quality).
nr,When I travel I like to be able to watch my local sports teams.
pos,I would highly recommend this to all.
nr,Got these speakers for X-mas.
neg,There's no treble control on the unit.
nr,I also own JBL Creatures which look and sound awesome plus have bass and treble control knobs on the sub.
nr,Of course the sound of either system can be adjusted via the equalizer in your Real or Windows Media Players.
pos,Back to the I-trigues; the more I listened to them the better they started to sound.
pos,The soundstage has gotten wider and the sound more detailed; quite unbelievable considering the narrow profile of the speakers.
pos,I like the wired remote w/ volume and bass controls & headphone and line-in jacks.
neg,Again a treble control would have been nice though.
pos,Overall very impressive speakers.
pos,"They also look great next to my 20"" monitor w/ their tall slender appearance."
mix,Pros: picture is great quick setup lots of inputs Cons: directions can be tricky to figure out This is an amazing TV for the price.
mix,Xbox 360 looks awesome but must have DCM off for any gaming or there is a crazy amount of response lag.
pos,HD tv channels look great kinda upset that I didn't switch to LCD earlier but also glad because the price is SOOO reasonable.
pos,Definitely recommend this to anyone looking to get a great LCD for a low price.
pos,This even drew compliments from my brother who has a panasonic plasma.
pos,Really enjoy that each input has its own settings (example: input 1 (xbox) I have DCM turned off.
nr,Input 2(tv) dcm is turned on to maximize the HD channels) Sound is not rated because I use a surround system to TV speakers have been on 0 volume since it came out of the box.
pos,Pros: Everything - seriously - stop looking and buy this.
mix,Great loud full sound - great colors - and scrren black blacks HD. Cons: The only downer would be lack of bluray but regular dvds look HD because the LED delievers far superior to my LCD Short story I went in to buy the IPAD and came out with this ‚Äì that's saying something.
pos,Pros- This I3 is actually a limited I7 and it's the processor apple was going to use in its 13inch Macbook but it was too expensive to upgrade the rest of the components to match.
pos,Its 50 percent more powerful than a similar turon or core 2 duo of the same specs. and it outperforms both the Macbook air 13inch $1700 and Macbook pro $1499 in fact the I5 simply allows for more end use ram and virtual processors a feature yet to be taken advantage of for most users but one necessary for future proofing and currently for high end graphic intensive software.
pos,I'm saying that except for those last two things I mentioned and the fact that its running windows ‚Äì this baby matches the power of a 2200 dollar Mac book.
pos,Its got 1696 video memory compared to my Macs 512 a 7200 rpm drive compared to the Macs 5200 both have led screens but the Macs got 1280 by 800 compared to this which has only 1366 by 768 ‚Äì though it doesn't seem to matter.
pos,Both have great displays.
pos,This lets you know that your actually running this thing easy and that it can handle even the toughest jobs.
pos,Its screen a 720p led actually outperforms my 1080p Sony LCD laptop visually.
mix,The blacks are blacker giving the colors a pop along with the sheen of the screen - which unfortunately does pick up glare as its not matte - the only downside besides not having a Bluray. However by turning up the brightness I was able to compensate.
pos,Lastly its case is fingerprint free its speakers are movie experience loud hard to find on a laptop and its HDMI de ...
nr,This is my third set.
nr,(Before I had Motorola that I returned and Plantronics Voyager 510 that I lost).
neg,I do have an issue with noise (especially when it is windy).
neg,I also have excessive noise when I talk and have phone in my pocket while walking.
nr,But other models are no better.
nr,Is it the nature of the beast?
pos,Simple to set up and use.
pos,FM function allows you to play music on your phone through your car stereo.
pos,Nice touch.
pos,Connected to radio first time with no problems.
nr,Same as using an Ipod with fm transmitter.
nr,discerning social gathering wants & expects to hear...
nr,the sophisticated private domain for the well-heeled uber cool society...
neg,Please don't buy it...
neg,The music contains full of pretentious French lyrics and the beat is flat.
neg,It runs on and on again ...It is really boring music.
neg,I think the dj tried so hard to be in the scene and he impresses no one at the end.
nr,Let me preface this review by saying that I don't hate Paul Oakenfold.
nr,I don't have a personal vendetta to pursue against him and in fact I absolutely love Bunkka and Tranceport.
neg,That said this album is very poor.
nr,Oakenfold is one of the main reasons I began to love trance electronica and even dance.
nr,When I first heard Tranceport I was amazed with what I was hearing and began to dig into a whole new world of music I had never known about before.
nr,I owe Mr. Oakenfold a debt for turning me on to music I now love and listen to on a daily basis.
neg,Unfortunately Oakenfold has stumbled quite a bit in this collection.
nr,This is not a trance album.
neg,It is a collection of pop-happy fluff filler and unremarkable songs that simply don't appeal to me at all.
neg,I realize that opinions vary and I'm sure I'll get lit up for writing a delnegative review but I really felt obligated to let people know to save their money.
neg,Now it seems that many of the vocals are too heavy for the music and the beat gets lost in the background.
neg,Even the remix of Southern Sun found in this collection is inferior to the original.
neg,"Also many of these tracks are just filler or fluff such as the James Bond Theme redel""mix"
neg,"I honestly can't think of a time when I want to listen to trance and I think to myself ""You know what would be great?"
neg,"Listening to some movie soundtrack redel""mix"
nr,If this is a collection of Oakenfold's 'greatest' hits then were are tracks like 'Gamemaster' from Tranceport or 'Ready Steady Go' from Bunkka?
nr,Where is 'Zoo York' and 'Get em up' also from Bunkka?
neg,It is a collection of meaningless passionless remixes or pop dance tunes.
neg,If you loved Tranceport don't spend your money on this CD. If you loved Bunkka don't spend your money either.
pos,If you love movie sound tracks pop remixes or soft edged dance music you might enjoy this CD.
nr,For a remix collection to be worth anything it has to add to or do better than the original tracks.
neg,In this case Last Night was a pretty poor effort by Moby standards and this remix collection is miles away from the brilliance of Play or the solidly constructed Hotel. Relatively bad songs remix
neg,Moby's ill advised exploration of disco gets even worse here.
neg,This a forgettable collection that only the most dedicated of Moby fans will want to purchase.
neg,1.5/5 stars.
neg,An uncommon misstep for Moby.
neg,While I am a huge fan of Beyonce when I bought this record I listened to it...and the very same day sold is for 5 dollars at a discount used CD store.
neg,Maybe this was a bit harsh but after the grueling hour I spent trying to find quality music in this hip-hop/pop trash maybe it wasn't punishment enough.
nr,Beyonce Knowles is a very talented woman: She is a good actress (which we are to see more of this summer) she has a great voice if put to good use she writes catchy radio-ready songs and can produce like no one else.
nr,"Maybe this is why the last Destiny's Child album"" """"Survivor"""""" was such a success Beyonce fully controlled the writing and producing of each track."
neg,"On ""Dangerously In Love"" she hands some of the control over into apparently very unable hands."
mix,"The best track on this record is clearly ""Crazy in Love"" an urban love tale that gets you movin' and singing along...but every track after it is a total dissapointment."
neg,Signs co-written with Aaliyah's muse Missy Elliot is a mess of nothing...driveling on about Astrology in a way that is neithor catchy nor creative.
neg,"But the absolutely worst song on this album would have to be ""Gift From Virgo""; Six minutes of Beyonce throwing her voice all up and down the octave chart with words so incredibly vapid you would think a valley girl with a 2.0 grade point average had written it."
neg,The most annoying thing about this song is she keeps changing pitch about every 5 words or so we're hearing a new tune.
neg,It sounds almost like when you put a tape in a player and it eats the tape and is just as enjoyable.
neg,"The one song Beyonce seems to want to make a big deal about is ""Dangerously In Love"" a remake of the enchanting love Ballad first performed by Beyonce's girl group Destiny's Child. This I wouldn't have a problem with if it were a remake at all instead of an exact replica."
neg,But believe me this is still not a reccomendation.
neg,If you want to hear Beyonce Knowles at her best buy any of the three Destiny's Child album and don't bother with an album that sounds like 40 songs had a car accident.
neg,It's saddening to see talent put to waste both from Beyonce her song writers and producers who usually make such great music on their own.
nr,Let's just hope they lose each other's numbers.
neg,"Chingy's followup to 2003's ""The Jackpot"" falls disasterously lower than his debut."
neg,Not many of the songs grabbed my attention his voice gets real annoying after a while too.
mix,Don't get me wrong there are a couple dope songs to bump in your ride but its not worth purchasing the whole cd for them.
mix,Hot Tracks: Balla Baby Make That Ass Talk Don't You Worry All the Way to St. Lou 26's Don't Really Care The rest of the tracks are way below what my expectations were.
neg,Chingy is just another one of those rappers that put out wack music just because he's guarnteed to at least go platnium or even more.
neg,It's just rediculous that people would buy this crappy album.
neg,Don't even waste your money.
neg,Well i hate to be the only dissenter in an ocean of metal wannabe 12-16yr olds but this album is an absolute joke.
neg,a complete rip-off and about as generic as it gets it combines the most commercially viable aspect of Nirvana (loud guitars and screaming) with the down-tuned sound of Korn. Truely this band would do better to become a tribute band which in many respects they are.
neg,So obviously designed for kids to allow them to shock mummy and daddy i find it quite sad that 9 blokes decided to adopt this image to sell records.
neg,It is as manufactured as Britney Steps 5ive etc and on the same level musically.
neg,The whole mask and boiler siut thing also causes me no end of amusement especially when they claim that it makes it more about the music and not about their identities.
nr,"Just scroll down the reviews and see how many kidies have referred to their ""disturbing"" and ""satanic"" image."
neg,The songs are actually really bad as well with the possible exception of Wait and bleed.
neg,As a whole i would recomend bands such as Tool AIC and other authentic metal rather than this sorry lot.
neg,manufactured anger for a manufactured audience.
neg,And no kiddies this is not being rebellious.
neg,"If this CD is ""remastered"" it certainly was not from the 1st generation multi-track session tapes."
neg,"From listening to this CD I can hear distortion and an audible amount of tape hiss"" especially through the quiet passages of """"I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face""""."""
neg,"And after all these years"" we STILL get """"Mexican Shuffle"""" in MONO!"""
neg,Which leads me to believe that this and other TJB CD's in Herb Alpert's Signature Series were mastered to CD directly from the original mix down album masters that were used to press the original A&M vinyl LP's back in the 1960s (a common practice that was routinly done by the record industry with past album masters during the dawn of the CD era 25 years ago which magnified the imperfections of analog album masters on CD).
neg,In this day and age of today's advanced digital technology a golden opportunity to digitally remix and remaster some of the greatest music of the '60s was missed.
nr,Maybe Universal given time would have done a much better job at remastering these early A&M classic albums.
nr,"I say this because in my opinion"" I think the people at Universal are doing an outstanding job at remastering some of the Motown material (ie """"The Motown Box"""")."""
neg,Sorry Herb but I think you missed the boat with this series.
nr,It pains me to give a King's X album such a low score.
nr,I mean I own the entire catalog I've seen the band live at least ten times and have even had beers with the guys after a show.
nr,I remember hearing them for the first time as a kid watching late-night TV when their video for Over My Head made a splash for a while on MTV. I've been a fan ever since.
nr,But alas I have to be truthful and honest about this collection as nothing less will benefit the band or fans.
neg,This is a sub-par album for any band let alone one as stellar as King's X. As many have already mentioned it's a modern recording of a bunch of rehashed throw-away tunes that didn't make it onto their first album Out of the Silent Planet. They were put in the circular file then and that's honestly where they should have stayed.
neg,The sound is dated the structures are boring the lyrics are juvenile and banal...need I go on?
neg,It's cheesy 1980s pop-rock that is barely saved by the fact that it being played by a band with incredible execution.
mix,Screamer is novel enough but that's the problem: it's merely a novelty song to show off Doug's screaming ability.
mix,Rock Pile has a decent enough verse but the chorus is sickeningly goofy.
neg,Johnny is the epic tune that doesn't justify its epic length...Ty's long solo is the most pointless meandering bunch of swoops and ambient sounds he's ever put together into a single chain.
neg,Honestly this album should be avoided by anyone except collectors.
neg,It is definitely not the place to start if you're just trying to get into King's X. If you really want to support this band buy their latest CD Ogre Tones which is an excellent excellent album.
nr,"It has a great variety of sound"" and should satisfy both their later fans that are used to the """"heavy"""" version of King's X as well as their earlier fans that long to hear the soaring guitar and Beatlesesque harmonies."""
nr,I'm a fan of both eras truly and I think it's their best CD since Please Come Home Mr. Bulbous and possibly since Dogman (another awesome disc that everyone should own).
mix,Avoid this one but don't avoid King's X. I'm one of those music nerds who owns like 1500 CDs and if I had to give up all but say 100 of them I would take up slots in that batch for all of my King's X CDs. This is one of the best overall rock bands still recording that hasn't ever sold out and keeps pumping out great tunes.
mix,They deserve many a listen...just don't start with Black Like Sunday.
neg,Not sure why they would release this album in this shape.
neg,Sounds like a mix between Urban and Black with alot of old tired riffs.
nr,Where is the Brad Paisley with the rockin' guitar sound?
neg,The producers never even feature 1 song where his playing takes control.
pos,The jazz into on the instrumental song is the best part of this whole album.
neg,I saw Brad at the Oprey way back when and I must say I knew he would be a star but this album is sooo lack-luster very disappointing.
nr,Regards.
nr,Before I start I'm just gonna say I'm not an amazing reviewer but I am going to give an honest review.
nr,I am definately not the biggest Beyonce fan by far as I usually like to stray away from mainstream music as often as I can being such over processed crap as most of it is.
nr,But this is Beyonce we're talking about she has amazing talent and an amazing vocal range.
neg,Which is why I'm so appalled that she had the audacity to release such an album.
neg,"It's almost like she's saying"" """"I'm Beyonce"" I'm amazing and people will jump on anything I create"" so why even make an attempt."""""""
neg,I'm one of the idiots who purchased the deluxe album and after unwrapping it at home and actually checking out the track listing and such all of these songs could have DEFINATELY fit onto one album.
neg,There was nothing deluxe about it.
neg,After listening to the first disc I almost felt I had to check my stereo to make sure I didn't have the same song on repeat over and over.
neg,The entire first disc is nothing but power ballads that lack just that power.
neg,There was no emotion they all sounded exactly the same: bland dull and over-polished.
neg,It made me feel like she went into the studio and just recorded each track to the same intrumental back to back and called it a night.
nr,The second disc I'm assuming was supposed to be the disc with club anthems party songs and such.
nr,"It had the typical ""independent"" ladies song"" and the typical ""boast like a man"" song."
mix,"Basically the only song worth anything on this entire collection is the song ""Single Ladies"" which I'm still not bananas about."
neg,Beyonce you're incredible but this album was a slap in the face to all of your fans and anyone who even mildly liked you.
neg,Giving it two stars is generous and I wasn't in the mood.
neg,It definately seems like I'm bashing Beyonce in this review but I'm not bashing her I'm bashing her feeble effort in this album release.
nr,I'm sure she'll notice the poor feedback from this cd and the next will be incredible.
nr,She should definately take her time and create an album with songs that have some staying power.
neg,Because if there ever was a Beyonce album to forget in the dust it's definately this one.
nr,I'm a younger Andrews Sisters fan.
nr,"I was first turned onto them when I heard ""Rum and Coca Cola"" - did I want to hear more after that!"
neg,This is NOT the great version I heard!!!
mix,In the 50's they re-recorded their hits for Capitol and 3 of them are here - Rum and Coca Cola I'll Be With You In Apple Blossom Time and Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy (the rest however are originals Begin the Beguine is super.)
nr,You've never heard these songs until you've heard the originals.
neg,I'd stay away from Captiol CD's or compilation CD's which include Capitol re-recordings of the Andrews like this one.
nr,The original Rum & Coca Cola and Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy are pure magic!
neg,Anyone can easily tell these are not the original hits.
nr,"It's good that they put ""Newly Recorded"" on the cover so at least they don't mislead you."
nr,If you're like me you want the original hit.
neg,"There is no way that ""Puppy Love"" or ""Diana"" can sound the same when sung by a 21 year old man as they do when sung by a 14 year old superprodigy whose voice hasn't changed."
nr,Ever since discovering the Dark Side - I have been a PF fanatic.
nr,Roger's themes and words Nick Mason's powerful rhythms Rick's eerie atmospheres and backgrounds and Gilmour's spacey and energetic soloes made for one helluva a 70's supergroup.
neg,Gilmour's attempts at emulating Roger's unique lyricism have fallen somewhat short.
pos,"Some elements still exist - ""Poles Apart"" and ""Coming Back To Life"" are strong efforts on this album."
neg,However it makes one yearn hard for the classic days of PF's heyday.
nr,The previous release in the Back To Love series was a closing of the chapter from '89-'91 and it was an amazing finish to that era and so I was excited to see what 92-96 classics featured on the next instalment.
pos,On disc one you have the beautiful vocals of Barbara Tucker with 'Beautiful People'.
pos,From there there are sure-fire classics from Kim English De'Lacy Lovetribe Bucketheads and Basement Jaxx. Disc two includes some of my personal classics from Njoi My Friend Sam and after months of trying to find 'Perfect Motion' in it's entirity it ends up on this collection which I have to take my hat off to HK for.
neg,To my surprise 'Who Keeps Changing Your Mind?'
neg,was FADED OUT after only 4 mins!!!
pos,Rounding off the album are some great end of the night belters from X-Press 2 Alcatraz and Grace. I've been ever increasingly worried about the quality of the compilations coming out of HK towers of late.
nr,It will be interesting to see who comes out on top!
nr,Genres and sub-genres annoy me.
nr,I know they're a necessary evil and that they help the less industrious music fan dig through mounds of music and hopefully come up with something that jives with their tastes.
nr,However there comes a point when genre sub-genre and sub-sub-genre classifications become more of a distraction than a meaningful way of choosing music.
mix,Sadly while I enjoy most of the music I cannot engage with the vocals.
neg,Lead singer Nike Nile's voice just doesn't do it for me.
pos,I still give it 3 stars because the music itself is good if not great.
nr,This was my first time hearing Il Divo and I dove into ‚ÄúThe Promise‚Äù CD headfirst and with great expectations.
neg,Perhaps I set the bar too high because I was sorely disappointed.
mix,The music is beautiful but alarmingly soporific and tedious.
mix,The singers have wonderfully clear and resonant voices and take great care and precision in delivering every note perfectly to the effect that the passion is never allowed to seep through.
mix,One of the few bright spots in this album was L'Alba del Mondo an Italian adaptation of Ennio Morricone's ‚ÄúI Knew I Loved You (Deborah's Theme).‚Äù The addition of some more familiar renditions such as ‚ÄúHallelujah‚Äù and ‚ÄúAmazing Grace‚Äù make it more bearable but are not enough to overcome the dreary one-note atmosphere that plagues the album.
nr,I will check out Il Divo's previous works with optimism but sadly this is one promise that is never delivered.
nr,Well the title of this review says it all.
nr,Yeah I'll be that guy.
mix,Sorry he is a good DJ to see live but he has put out a lot better work like Project Human the 6ixth Session and System Upgrade.
neg,"Also how many times is Dieselboy going to have del""mix"
neg,"Comeon. I think Dieselboy also should have included ""Submission"" and ""Barrier Breaks"" from the 12"" he did with Kaos. How could he you not include those 2 new hot tracks on your album??"
pos,If you like militaristic dnb and are unfamiliar with all of Dieselboy's other works you'll love this album.
nr,Many music listeners today don't realize that back in Robert Johnson's day (1930's) a musician played a lot of parties as his primary gigs and whatever the partygoers wanted to hear he was expected to know how to play (that is if he wanted to be paid well and keep working!)
nr,"A tune such as ""They're Red Hot"" a blistering swing/ragtime/cakewalk number more reminiscent of Louis Armstrongs Hot Fives & Sevens rather than the repetoir of a legendary blues Delta slide player like Johnson"" might be featured along side more typical Johnson fare like """"Come On In My Kitchen"""" or """"Hellhound""""."""
nr,Surprise Surprise!
mix,Red Hot is far and away the best number on this mostly disappointing disc as Eric and band quit sounding as reverential as church and sprint thru the number with gusto.
pos,Billy Preston's tinkling piano and Jerry Portnoy's wonderful harp provide the musical highpoints.
mix,"32-20 Blues ""If I Had delpos session Over Judgement Day"" and Me and The Devil Blues"""" are just about the only other good interpretations offered here."""
neg,Most of the other songs are saddled with sludgy over-reverential takes that lack soul and life.
nr,What happened to the great live-in-the-studio feel of From The Cradle another all-blues masterpiece recorded just ten years ago to much better effect?
nr,(He drops into this mode from time to time; he practically lived in this mode the entire decade of the seventies.)
neg,"For example"" compare Eric's lame take of """"When You've Got A Good Friend"""" with Savoy Brown's excellent version from their 1999 album Blues Keep Me Holding On. No contest: Guitarist Kim Simmonds and his famous Gibson Flying V fly circles around Eric's rendition."
delneg,"And the remake of Hellhound on My Trail"""" Johnson's signature tune??"
delneg,What a disappointment!!
nr,For this take Eric should have sent the band home and played the entire song with acoustic and slide.
delneg,Sounds more like a rabid poodle on his trail rather than a hellhound!!
nr,In closing what can I say?
mix,The album does have several good offerings mostly on the uptempo numbers but Eric should now go back to square one and get in touch with his inner Johnson.
nr,Please???
nr,I have been a big Commissioned fan since I was a kid.
nr,When this album came out I was very excited because I was so upset when the original members of Commissioned broke up.
pos,I must say this album really grew on me when I saw the DVD. In my books the music gets a 5 star rating for sure it was off the chain.
nr,Hearing all the songs I remember just brought nothing but memories.
neg,To me it was just not original.
mix,Don't get wrong if I lost for broke this cd I will buy it again It was a good project I just wish different things could have been done.
mix,Don't get wrong if I lost for broke this cd I will buy it again It was a good project I just wish different things could have been done.
nr,"There will never be another Commissioned like the original members"""" I do wonder why Michael Brooks wasn't a part of the reunion"" Michael Brooks is the man everyone!!"
nr,"Seriously he is so gifted great on the keys and is one of the best"" if not """"THE BEST"""" song writer in the music industry."""
nr,He wrote most of the songs for Commissioned the fact he wasn't there did disappointed me.
pos,The lyrics of Commissioned gets a 5 star rating because they didn't compromise their message with the world their message was design to uplift your spirit so I must say thank you Commissioned for being a part of my childhood life your music lives on and on!!
nr,Peace!!
nr,This is a tough one.
nr,"When I heard Mari√© Digby on NPR's Morning Edition Saturday with Scott Simon last year"" I was so taken with her voice and style that I immediately downloaded """"Unfold"""" from iTunes."""
nr,The album was enchanting from open to close and most of its tracks remain in heavy rotation on my iPod.
nr,Mari√©'s passion sincerity and beauty came through loud and clear in well-produced but organic arrangements.
nr,I could listen to this collection of songs over and over without losing interest.
nr,Mari√© is clearly a music wonk.
nr,She loves it; she lives it!
nr,"She works hard at her craft and the success of ""Unfold"" garnered her a well-deserved higher profile."
nr,And she never stops!
nr,Look at the wealth of content on her YouTube channel if you think she's not among the hardest working musicians in the business.
nr,She was clearly keen to explore a new path.
nr,Breathing Underwater is the expression of this desire.
nr,"Mari√© is completely ga-ga over her new ""baby."""
nr,And that's as it should be.
neg,But I must confess that the new album falls fairly flat for me.
neg,The acoustic production that made her stand out has been replaced with drum machines multi-layering and auto-tuning.
neg,"The delicate"" vine-laden garden lattice of """"Unfold"""" has been replaced by a hard"" brick wall of sound this time out."
nr,Mari√© is the beautiful woman who doesn't need makeup; you cringe a little bit when you see her layer it on in an apparent attempt to be more like her peers.
nr,In the end it's Mari√©'s call alone as to where she takes her music.
nr,"I have no doubt that ""Breathing Underwater"" will do very well for her."
neg,But it doesn't do much for me.
nr,Did I buy it?
nr,"For $2.99"" and given my affection for """"Unfold"""" I could not resist."
nr,And I will listen to it several times hoping that something about it grabs me.
nr,"Unfold"""" grabbed me right away and has yet to let go."""
nr,That will likely be my best chance to hear acoustic versions of the new songs.
nr,"Formed by a former Throbbing Gristler and a buddy"" Coil is difficult to describe as anything but """"experimental"""" and """"electronic."""""""
nr,Some of their albums consist of little more than curious drones while others are swirling with noises the hearer's mind cannot contain.
nr,"*Loves Secret Domain* released on the now post-indie WaxTrax label and currently out of print collects a number of melodic"" pop-based """"songs"""" (they actually are coherent"""" with beginnings and ends) that are at times profoundly dancey (""""Snow"""")"" goth-y (as with the title track) meditative and pleasant or just plain WEIRD (the rest of the album)."
nr,"This their most accessible album tends to be their best in my opinion (proof enough that these bois are capable of good unpredictable"" thoroughly enjoyable """"pop"""")."""
nr,*Stolen and Contaminated Songs* consists literally of songs ripped from the WaxTrax album and reworked.
nr,Don't expect the sonata form!
nr,Only at the repeated insistence of my friend A. did I sit down and *really* listen to this album.
nr,I must admit that I regard much contemporary r&b and hip-hop with skepticism because of the same lack of individuality that is rife in the boy-band repertoire.
nr,"Anything with high praise on a big label (eg Columbia)--especially anything that gets high praise in ""awards"" shows must be sub par."
pos,The result is anything but ordinary.
pos,Her voice is silky and direct and her lyric smart and direct.
pos,This is pure soul--its naked bearing its deep hurt its highest joys.
pos,"The song"" """"To Zion"""" merits owning the album alone."
pos,In this tribute to her son Hill brings the listener to tears and expresses in a few short minutes what soul music is really about--its essence; a mother of music indeed.
pos,Simply amazing.
nr,"Just when we thought synth-pop was dead and buried the grizzled top end of Gen X decides it can't let go and nominates this Norwegian guy to rescue everything that was good about syth-eighties-dance (the romantic lyricism and desparing sense of death tomorrow"""") and lose everything that was bad (the overly-romantic lyricism and androgynous tweek of casios """"on the metro"""")."""
pos,Apoptygma Berzerk gets better with each album artfully programming a solid pop sensibility with cutting edge danceteria and gothadustrial seasonings.
pos,*Welcome to Earth* is a no holes barred pop dance explosion of the romantic strain (more akin to camoflage depeche mode and alphaville than moby prodigy or ministry) but offers up no limp wrists.
pos,Almost every track is amazing and of the sort which one wishes went on for another five minutes.
pos,A good corrective for Covenant fans who won't let go of the casios.
pos,Groth's use of female vocals and KORGs works much much better.
nr,Need to dance and sing too?
pos,This album is it for 2000!
pos,Only 5 Stars!!!
pos,If I could I'd give Beethoven's Wig 2 ten or more stars!
pos,Richard Perlmutter has done it again - this cd is brilliant and has quickly become a beloved cd for our entire family.
pos,There is nothing better than listening to my children hum classical music and sing the lyrics to these great masterpieces!
pos,Every family should own a copy of this great CD!
pos,We can't wait for Beethoven's Wig 3!
pos,This set of 6 CDs takes the book of the Cosmic Jesus one step further.
nr,The book explores the Words of Jesus in their original Aramaic.
pos,The CD book takes those concepts and Douglas-Klotz' scholarship into the realm of the auditory.
pos,The author/speaker carefully explains the meanings of the sayings of Jesus in their original Aramaic then teaches the listener the language forms of the various words.
pos,He then takes it to the next step of providing chants for use in meditation.
pos,These chants are accompanied by modern but appropriate guitar music and enable the listener/participator to enter more sensually into the original language.
pos,This is an extremely useful set of CDs for anyone who wishes to develop their spiritual meditative life.
nr,Interestingly I would have expected that it would be suitable only for a Christian participator.
pos,However the understanding of the Aramaic words gives such a clear liberal theological and spiritual basis of the unity of the Creator that it is accessible to anyone of any religious or spiritual tradition.
pos,"Having used the CDs and having read the original book"" I am also left wondering how """"The Passion of Christ"""" a la Mel Gibson could use the Aramaic in order to present such a traditional conservative and violent view of the life and death of Jesus without leading the viewers into a more universal expression of compassion that is so evident in the CDs. Fully recommended"""
nr,"First of all"" let me elaborate on the term """"melodic death metal""""."""
nr,"I do not mean ""Gothenburg"" bands but more accurately Death Metal that contains some melody."
nr,Now that we've got that out of the way...
pos,Anata is one of those rare bands that hasn't yet written a bad song.
pos,"While most people are only familiar with their third album"" """"Under A Stone With No Inscription"""""" I'm here to tell you that this album is every bit as worthy of praise."
pos,It is still quality though with a massive slow riff in the middle.
nr,From here the songs become more melodic with vocalist/guitarist/main man Fredrik Shalin alternating between growled and screamed vocals.
pos,"The third song"" """"Under Azure Skies"""""" deserves a paragraph of its own."
pos,This my friends is one of the best metal songs I've ever heard period.
nr,Battery.
nr,Angel Of Death. Davidian.
nr,Heartwork.
pos,Blinded By Fear. Under Azure Skies. It deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as these classics.
pos,Beginning with slow chugging riffs it is after the first verse that it kicks into high gear harmonies running rampant.
pos,But then the song breaks down into a bass-led melody with Schalin at first almost speaking the lyrics then screaming over the soft music.
pos,I'm butchering the description but it's really a powerful piece.
pos,The song picks up again with more heart-wrenching harmonies screams and pounding drums.
pos,Simply godly.
pos,I could go on and on about this wonderful album but I won't.
nr,Instead I'll just leave you to check out some of the music and then maybe you'll buy it.
pos,Recommended like a rest after a hard day's work.
nr,"In an earlier review I had stated that TD's ""Melrose"" was their most haunting since this one."
pos,"Well ""Hyperborea"" is their absolute most haunting an surreal cd ever in my book."
pos,It really does as reviewer Morse put it take you on a visual journey-you really do feal like you are there.
pos,I actually imagined myself amongst the pyramids and the Sphynx on the track 'Sphynx Lightening'.
pos,And on the title track 'Hyperborea' I could see myself on a barren yet breath-taking frozen landscape.
pos,If you like a surreal sound this is the one for you.
pos,And yes as reviewer Morse also stated you do have to listen closely for the subtle changes in style and tone(just when you think you are hearing a Celtic sort of sound it moves on to something else and it challenges you to try and figure it out).
pos,"You could actually(and this may appall the most devout new age listeners!)consider ""Hyperborea"" 'nature music' for it does indeed transport you to natural locales and states of mind."
nr,Does that sound like someone on an acid trip?
pos,Just buy it and you'll understand.
pos,And you should also enjoy it immensely.
nr,Rock is not always about intensity.
nr,Just because a song has no screaming and yelling does not mean it is not a good song.
pos,A little more intensity would not hurt this album BUT it is a good one.
nr,Who knows...
nr,maybe Staind will surprise everyone with a new CD eventually with the same intensity as before or even more.
pos,But this CD is AWSOME!!!
pos,They are so great and they give Atlanta a good reputation.
pos,I love their cd and I love them.
pos,They are cute and they can sing and dance.
pos,They do stuff their own way.
pos,So people don t like them cause of that but they are good and their cd is good.
nr,JoJo or Ciara would be good singing with them.
pos,This record blows my mind.
pos,It is at once catchy hummable and avant-garde.
pos,"There are two big ""wow"" points here."
pos,"The first is the ""string"" (le fil) a tone that persists throughout the entire record (and beyond into secret-track land)."
pos,This literally ties the entire record together and makes you listen to it as a suite: not that the songs don't stand by themselves but this persistent note just keeps pulling you into the next one.
pos,The second big thing is that it is arranged almost all a cappella.
pos,Yes there are instruments.
pos,But no the instruments don't take center stage.
pos,It's all about the voice the human beatbox and the clap.
pos,This gives the record a real organic feeling: it doesn't sound as if it was spit out of a hit factory.
pos,I am amazed at Camille's self-assurance in making a record like this that relies so wholly on her own voice to carry it.
pos,The lyrics are wry funny and thought-provoking but in my mind are almost completely occluded by the breathtaking arrangements and production.
nr,I am sure many people will browse this CD on Amazon and imagine that it's some kind of folk-song/chanson update along the lines of Keren Ann Carla Bruni or Coralie Clement.
pos,It's not; it's more wonderful and inspiring and adventurous than those ladies' music.
pos,Incomparable is really the best word to describe Le Fil.
neg,Disappointing I love the whole sims 2 series but for me this game was fun at first but got boring after 2 days.
neg,I had an urge to play again and only kept it on for 5 minutes because of how bored I was.
nr,This game's challenge is to make a town into a five star town but to do this you must make items for your sims and houses throughout the whole game and find essences.
neg,This game also doesn't have a lot of building items after I made a couple places my houses started to look the same.
neg,My friend had said before I bought it to don't get it but I thought it looked so fun I wanted it and didn't know what he was talking about but then after I regretted it.
mix,Oter than that the sims are really cute but you also don't get a lot of clothes to choose from when you make your character.
neg,I was highly disapointed with this game.
pos,You got to be the scorpion king and learn to kick bad guy butt while also dishing out insults.
pos,I would enjoy it because you would get weapons such as swords and daggers.
nr,"You'd then battle ""ancient evils"" in the name of good."
nr,These ancient evils would be evil gods and monsters and their minions would be men snakes and dogs (rabid dogs not puppies).
neg,What I didn't like about this game was that the last level was just like the first.
neg,You always had the same weapons techniques and the minions would always act the same!
neg,They all just staggered back when they died and always seemed to come out of nowhere!
neg,Then the bosses weren't even historically accurate and it didn't take a historian to figure that out!
neg,The fist boss was Anubus and another was medusa so the creators just threw in some Greek gods with the Egyptian ones!
mix,So to sum it up: OK: The graphics (on a scale of 1 to ten; 4) The music (it was ok but not awe in spiring) BAD: The weapons (there were only four different kinds and one type of shield) The bosses (Egyptian and Greek Gods DON'T mix
neg,The levels (the same thing over and over) The minions (they always acted the same like they just had different skins or something) I wouldn't recommend buying this game for someone with experience but if you just got a gamecube and the price is right ($5 or less) then maybe consider it.
neg,All flash no substance Features -All skill-requiring mini-games have been removed!
neg,Newborns can now enjoy Mario Party!
neg,Yay! -Use of the microphone!
neg,Because everybody loves microphone games!
neg,But it's cool if you don't have one because then you have a space on every board that does nothing!
neg,Awesome eh?
neg,#NAME? annoying new game mechanics!
neg,Let's just say I'm glad I rented.
nr,Well I'm being kind of harsh.
nr,Drop by your local gamestop and play the demo of this game.
nr,There's this one mini-game with go-karts that has you think 'All I have to do is move the joystick and press A!
nr,Hahaha how easy' but then you run into walls.
neg,That's the only real apeal to this game though I don't think any more poorly of the Mario Party series for this game....it's just not worth buying...
nr,Just finished playing Batman: Arkham Asylum and it occurs to me that the true single player shooter/RPG is dead long live the shooter/RPG. I say this because I finished B:AA in a little over a day.
nr,Remember when Zelda or Silent Hill or Final Fantasy or Metal Gear provided weeks of immersive escapist delight?
nr,Now these kinds of single player experiences have basically been given lip service and effectively jettisoned in exchange for gratuitous (albeit cool) super-graphics boring and useless cut scenes (I want to play I don't want to watch) and worst of all expanded on-line circle jerkage.
nr,Really with an environment like Silent Hill to suck you in and scare the crap out of you for three solid befuddling weeks do I really care if I can enter an online world where I'm competing against some angst-ridden suicidal pimply faced vapid goth pre-adolescent pre-teen with mommy/daddy issues?
nr,Oh and not just like one of them but like dude like hundreds like yo?
nr,Please bring back the day where an old fart like me can fire up the X-Box or the Playstation (not the Wii give me a break) and look forward to weeks and weeks of kick butt shooter/RPG action and adventure and frights and delights.
nr,You can take your on-line mosh pits and shove them.
nr,Somebody please bring back a true single player gaming experience!
neg,Very rarely do you come across a game like this and I'm extremely glad for this.
neg,The second installment in the Final Fantasy Legends series is probably the worst and later on becomes physically painful to play.
neg,Story : 1/10 Here's where things start to go bad.
nr,You get woken up one night by your father and he tells you about the 77 pieces of ''Magi'' spread across the world that when put together form a statue.
nr,You obviously go in search of them.
neg,Normally I don't have problems with simple stories but when combined with the monotony of the quest you'd think they would have written a better story to keep you interested.
neg,Gameplay : 1/10 As you journey around you have to battle against other monsters and buy weapons/armour like any other game.
neg,The only problem with FFL2 is the fact that you never gain a ''level'' you just randomly gain stats which gets annoying since you have to spend so much more time ''level'' building than any other RPG I've played.
neg,And when you get to the later levels and the monsters are extremely tough this becomes even more annoying with the limited weapons use.
neg,You have say ''hit points'' for each weapon for example: You equip a sword and it can only be used 15 times before breaking.
neg,Now of course as you continue onwards you find that weapons become even more expensive and slowly begin having less and less hit points so when you do want to ''level'' up you have to get new weapons every several battles just to keep leveling up which takes all your gold which means to do anything else you need to go fight....
neg,it's an endless cycle that becomes annoying in the later sections when you face up against some extremely hard boss characters.
neg,Luckily you do run into a few ''super'' weapons that don't have any ''hit points'' but they're very few and by the time you find them you've probably already grown sick of this game and thrown it against a wall.
neg,Sound : 1/10 A problem that seems to infest all the other GB FFL games is the overly ''sad'' music.
neg,Normally I don't complain about music but in most games the tunes are at least halfway decent and you can continue playing without having to have the game on mute.
neg,But with FFL2 the music just is so repetitive and melancholy even during the ''happy'' parts of this game.
neg,Replay Value : 1/10 If you have enough strength to go through this game once trust me you'll never want to go through it again.
nr,Rental/Purchase?
neg,Unless you really adored the original FFL STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!
neg,EVEN IF YOU SEE IT FOR ONLY 2 DOLLARS!
neg,DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS GAME!
neg,Pick up FFA or FFL3 for halfway decent Final Fantasy games on the GB. Final Comments: I was stuck with this game and Mario Golf being my only entertainment on a cross country trip (I lost 4-5 of my GBC/GB games in a hotel room) and every time I tried to stomach through this game I kept running back to Mario Golf. Please if you want a good game get anything but this.
neg,look i bought this game one day and with in 2 days i had beaten it 3 times on the hardest difficulty.
nr,im not even a hard core gamer more of a casual one.
neg,i wouldnt really suggest buying it unless ur one of those who pick something up and can play 5 min of it and not play it for a long time.
neg,not really any replay value and theres only 1 special unlock at the end of the game after u get that its boring.
neg,so again i wouldnt advise any of u to buy it.
mix,its got pretty good graphics and the gameplay is pretty nice untill well u beat it in the first 2 hours.
neg,This is the worst port I've played in a long time.
neg,And I thought Mass Effect was bad.
neg,By comparison this game makes the transfer of Mass Effect from Xbox to PC look like a carefully designed masterpiece.
neg,The controls are lousy.
neg,You cannot access menus through use of the mouse which is so counter intuitive that it screams fail.
neg,The controls just always feel awkward no matter how much you tweak your key mapping.
neg,Miserable to play throughout.
neg,The graphics are crummy and despite having crossfired graphics cards (HD4870s).
neg,I can't get decent frames no matter what.
neg,I easily get 40-50 frames a second on very high in Crysis and Saints Row pulls an awful 20-27 despite having inferior graphics.
neg,Other problems include common clipping issues buildings and terrain that pops up out of nowhere and the worst skins I've seen on character models since 2004. The models are sloppy robotic looking and frankly ugly.
neg,Enemies get frozen in space stuck in doorways etc... It's so bad it's amateurish.
neg,The graphic problems alone make the game almost unplayable.
neg,Don't waste your money and try to play this game on the PC. It will frustrate you anger you and make you want to chuck the game in the trash.
neg,It cannot be played at high graphics even with a very high quality PC. I don't think they can even patch the thing to playability because of the graphic issues that may not be fixable.
neg,Don't buy under any circumstances.
nr,[***SPOILER***] Where do all these positive comments come from?
nr,Does Valve hire or pay people to rate this game with an average of 9?!? Come on!
nr,This can't be serious.
neg,Any (even just a little experienced) gamer who actually played this game must be disappointed.
nr,All the people I have spoken to in my neighbourhood think alike and somehow all the people here are EP1-addicted/fanatics?
nr,Where have you all been in the past few years?
mix,When you rate this EP1 with a 10 what were CoD (2) Battlefield (2) FEAR and HL2 then.....a 25??! Yes the graphics are great just as they were in HL2 (ok HDR is added and it does look nice but it's not that much of a difference).
nr,Some 'genious' used almost a year to come up with a....ZOMBIE!
neg,It's just a fatter and faster version of the standard-zombie from HL2. How refreshing.
neg,Did they become smarter?
neg,No...not at all.
neg,They just come rushing towards you.
nr,It feels like my duty to inform potential buyers.
nr,PLEASE go and play the game at a store or at an friends place.
neg,It surely ain't worth the $20-. Even at 'difficult' you will probably be able to end this game in about 2-3 hours.
neg,Do you pay for an superb new concept with fantastic eyecandy great gameplay and AI?
neg,No....you pay $20- for 3 hours 'more of the same'.
neg,Please Valve: Stop just making money....start making great games/expansions again.
pos,My 3 year old son absolutely loved playing this game.....
neg,until he finished it after 3 days.
neg,He cried for about 45 mins after the end credits rolled.
neg,He couldn't understand why there were no more levels to play.
neg,I tried to get him to play through it once more but he kept screaming.
neg,"I already played this story.
neg,I want more Diego!"
neg,My advice is to not buy this game for your children.
neg,Especially not any over 3 years old.
neg,It was a total waste of my money.
neg,If I could return it and get a refund I would.
neg,And I would get a game that's not so easy that a 3 year old can beat it in 3 days.
neg,Pros: It makes a great coaster for a frothy beverage!!!
neg,... Cons: Everything....
nr,explained below.
nr,Ok here's the bottom line.
nr,An avid Falconeer from the old days knows that this is a quickly repacked and cleaned up version of the SuperPak 4.2 series created off the original falcon4 code.
neg,simply THIS WAS RELEASED NOT TO REJUVINATE THE COMMUNITY BUT TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK. If ya wanna fly around and blow stuff up like a mongoloid retard BUY THIS SIM!
neg,If ya want emmersion and overall the highest levels of reality you can get buy the original Falcon4.0 disk and then go download either FreeFalcon4 from www.freefalcon.com/forums OR Openfalcon 4.5 from: www.f4forums.com/forum The best thing about those 2 sims are 1 - they're free 2 - They're not junk like Falcon4.0 allied Force is.
neg,Do youself a favor get your head's out from where ever you all have stuck them and get with the program either FreeFalcon or Openfalcon for true realisim and performance.
nr,#NAME?
neg,I accidentally die and GAME OVER... Then i release that my previous save point is far far beyong...
neg,I have been playing for abt 4 hrs and all th SAVE POINT i get to use is ONLY 4.... Cos without the save pt u cant save at all...
neg,even after u finish killing a Boss or tournment u cant even save...
neg,The distance between save pts is a few town away...
neg,wat the hell !!! So it was a waste of time...
neg,If they want to make save with onl at SAVE POINT then they should at least have one on every town...
neg,U cant imagine us playing for few hours and don't die at all...
neg,and if die is game over...
neg,Should have some checkpoint at least so that if we kill by boss then we cant rematch again...
neg,Thinking that if u go fight the boss without any saving...
neg,Is not that the boss is a sure win situation rite...
neg,there is a very high chance that we'll be kill by the boss...
pos,Pros: The cover actually has Cornet on it.
pos,Extra features after game play.
neg,... Cons: No original illustrations to find.
neg,No ability to change from English to Japanese in the music/subtitles.
neg,Original character expressions replaced with medicore digital drawings.
neg,Gaming grid system is gone.
neg,Took away game play settings.
nr,Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure is one of my most favorite games of all time.
nr,It's not the most dramatic or the most visually exciting but it brings charm hope and a smile to my face when I need it most.
neg,I was certainly one of the most excited fans out there when I heard this game was going to DS and the disappointment with all the features they left out of this game was appalling.
nr,One of the BEST features of the game is being able to change from Japanese to English in both the subtitles and music tracks!
nr,Why else would a fan want to play a MUSICAL GAME?
nr,Is that not the most important part that the characters sing?
neg,Another issue is the loss of the original design illustrations.
nr,Admittedly I am an illustrator but those illustrations were yet another golden cookie that added to my gaming experience.
neg,Also with the illustration issue the icons that represent the characters expressions when they're talking were JUST FINE the way they were and I do not see how REDRAWING all of them enhanced the experience.
neg,What time they spent redrawing those expressions they could have used to maintain the original grid system format for the DS. A different issue is the gameplay settings: Easy(aka never played a video game in your life) Medium (aka played one rpg) and Hard (aka easy mode on normal rpgs) have disappeared.
neg,Admittedly I'm sure we didn't NEED the settings but if anything making Rhapsody HARDER or adding an experience booster would've better than eliminating the settings all together.
neg,Converting this game to the DS could have been a lot simpler and would have given the fans more of what they wanted.
neg,I wish that NIS America had done more polls to fans to ask what we wanted.
neg,We are still out here and you have ruined the artistic integrity for this game.
pos,I do like finally having Cornet on the cover.
nr,The original game had a spoiler for a cover.
pos,It is also nice to enjoy extra features after gameplay.
nr,I don't want to entirely slam this game for fans.
nr,I would love to have a new generation of girl gamers to be able to enjoy this (sorry guys don't really see you playing this no offense).
neg,The next time a company remakes a game for fans THEY SHOULD ASK FIRST. BRING IT UP ON MORE FORUMS WE WILL BE INTERESTED.
nr,Don't believe the hype I wanted to love this game so bad.
nr,It seems lately all games are missing that old feeling I used to get that caused me to play a game for days and months.
neg,Unfortunately Assassins Creed failed with me also.
neg,The game play is annoying repetitive and stupidly hard.
neg,I have a lot of problems with this game.
neg,First of all you do the exact same things through the whole game.
nr,Save citizens pick pocket climb buildings to get to view points interrogate rinse repeat.
neg,The game never changes up it is the same all the way through.
neg,One of the most repetitive games I have ever played.
nr,The combat oh boy the combat.
pos,There are a lot of cool moves and fighting abilities you can use but you will never need too.
neg,I will now tell you all you need to know to survive any fight you get into hold RT hit X as soon as your foe attacks and you counter that's all you need to do.
neg,If they grab you hit B instead of X to break the hold.
neg,You have now mastered the fighting game.
nr,Now you ask why did you say this game is so hard if the fighting is easy?
neg,Let me explain the most annoying part even more annoying than the repetitiveness.
mix,Many missions require you to assassinate and go unnoticed understandable for this game and they are cool except it is all but impossible to go unnoticed.
nr,You can be minding your own business and boom the guards spot you and you are fighting again.
neg,Then guess what time to replay the whole segment but you have to listen and watch the same video and mission start again because there is no skip option.
neg,Brilliant loving this.
neg,Let's throw in the fact you have time limits on these assassination missions also and you get a completely annoying game that is cheap and will aggravate you past the point of reason.
neg,Why oh why did that 1 guard see me with 20 seconds left as I slowly walk back to my informant?
neg,Well time to try again.
neg,This is not fun.
nr,You are too stealth as an assassin right?
neg,And I agree the game should not be easy but it is almost impossible which really ruins a game based on stealth.
neg,Very disappointing for a game I looked forward too so much.
mix,Broken The Good: Decent story tons of gore great graphics and audio new features are neat The Bad: Abysmal combat terrible control extremely slow pace laughable voice acting I tried so hard to love RE1 and look beyond it's major flaws.
neg,Flaws such as the abysmal combat system.
neg,You can't aim at anything!
neg,The tank controls don't help either so you always end up dying CONSTANTLY and with a lack of health and ammo you'll toss your PS1/PS2/PS3/PSP out the window.
neg,The other flaw is the level design.
neg,Everything is so confusing and it's so easy to get lost.
neg,The map doesn't help one bit because all it does is highlight the hallway that you are in red and you have to decipher what doors go where.
neg,Another thing that doesn't help is the game's pace...it's sooooooo slow!
neg,When you open a door or walk up stairs the animations talk forever to finish menu are slow text is not skippable.
neg,Another flaw is the laughable and hideous voice acting.
neg,They actors sound like they're fresh out of remedial drama while the live action cut scenes are just as bad.
pos,The only good part about RE is the story enemies and the amount of gore there is.
neg,While DC offers vibration uncensorship and a few game play tweaks it's not worth it.
neg,RE4 was my first RE and going back to this is just awful.
neg,If you haven't played RE1 you're not missing much at all.
nr,All flash no substance Let me begin by saying that I do not currently nor do I have any plans to actually go out and purchase NBA Live 2006 for the Xbox360.
nr,I do own the Xbox version of Live and this review is off of the NBA Live 06 Demo available off the Live Marketplace and the extensive time I was able to get with the game at the Microsoft Xbox360 Zero Hour event.
nr,The most evident change from the last generation of consoles (PS2 Xbox GC) to the newest generation is the graphics.
nr,"To me it seems as though EA Sports spent a rather large majority of their time developing this game from ""scratch"" on the graphics."
pos,The arenas player models crowds coaches lighting and presentation are all the best I've ever seen in a basketball game.
pos,Yes I do think they are way better in this game than NBA 2k6 for the 360. The reason I feel this way is because the textures used for the skin look a lot better have more color and the sweat graphics look more realistic.
neg,The only problem I have with anything graphical are some of the transitions between animations in the game...
neg,they just don't seem to blend as well as I had hoped.
pos,On the gameplay side the difficulty settings allow for pretty good challenge between teams.
nr,The default settings are a little too slow for my liking but of course that can be changed.
neg,I gave this game a 6 for the gameplay because of the lack of features they included in this version of the game versus the Xbox 1 version.
neg,I mean no superstar moves no dunk contest where's franchise mode???
neg,The game seems to play more simulation type of bball but the numbers at the end of a game don't follow.
neg,Maybe next year or the version for the PS3 will be what Live gamers were expecting from a next generation title.
pos,The sound and presentation in the game are fantastic.
pos,The arenas feel alive and watching the game and the start screen is great.
neg,Finally I have to give this game such a low value rating because all you are getting for a $60 game is a single game mode basic season mode online play and create a player...
neg,I don't think it's right for EA to expect people to pay $10 more for less content compared to the past console versions.
neg,It's like NBA Live without serveral of the features that make Live such a fun bball series.
nr,I've owned every Crash Bandicoot game ever and am a big fan.
nr,This game is almost exactly like the old Crash Bandicoot platformers apart from a few noticable differences.
pos,The graphics are better and run very smoothly without a single hitch or framerate problem.
neg,The only thing is though is that if you've played Xbox games with great graphics Halo for instance then you will be disgusted by this games' graphics.
neg,Another thing-Crash does not play as well as he used to.
neg,Crash used to run- now he seems to run but very slowly.
neg,He runs as if he has been running for 400 miles beforehand.
neg,Also his movements and actions are very slow and he appears to glide when he jumps.
pos,Also if you are used to the difficulty level of every other Crash Bandicoot game ever made (which is stupidly easy) then you will be surprised by the Wrath of Cortex. It is very difficult and offers a great challenge especially the boss levels.
pos,Other than these The wrath of cortex is a very enjoyable platformer with some great action moments and puzzles to figure out.
neg,The only problem is if you enjoyed the previous Crash Bandicoot games you may be disappointed by his laest outing.
mix,I reccommend this only if you want a challenge or if you've never played a Crash Bandicoot game before.
neg,Disappointing The overall storyline of the game is held together by poor one-liners.
neg,The storyline is flat and uninventive.
neg,utterly disappointing.
nr,Asside from the storyline you have missions to complete.
neg,The only thing that holds these missions in context is the thin storyline so it ends up being a mission-based arena game with the difference that the arena maps are a bit larger than traditional arena games.
neg,The fighting is pretty uninventive unless I totally missed the point.
neg,You basically have spells and weapons then hack and slash your way through the enemies to the bosses.
neg,Finish the boss move on to the next mission.
neg,Considering the relatively small size of the maps the graphic detail could have been seriously improved.
neg,Even the special effects are lacking.
nr,If you want to play this I recommend you rent it at the local Blockbuster.
neg,Don't buy it its a waste of money.
mix,Pros: Simple and functional base gameplay.Amazingly good controls (the touch screen shines in this game)....Cons: The music is pretty annoying.The game will only last so long before getting stale.Default scores on scoreboard are too high.
nr,Zoo Keeper is basically Bejeweled.
nr,Most everyone and their mom have played Bejeweled.
nr,Which means people have basically played Zoo Keeper. That doesn't mean the game is bad.
pos,It's actually a very good puzzle game.
pos,And man that stylus control just makes you love the DS.Zoo Keeper's basic premise is to line up 3 or more same animals horizontally or vertically.
nr,This will make them disappear and anything above the animals in the line will fall to fill the space.
nr,There is a timer on the left side that you must keep from running out by capturing more animals.
pos,Simple but addicting.
pos,The game has a very easy learning curve.
pos,And it's a good game to play on a lazy day.The biggest reason I love this game is the fact that the stylus control just works so well.
nr,It makes it seem like Bejeweled (Zoo Keeper) was initially designed for the DS. Click on the animal and drag and it will rotate in the direction you drag.
pos,It's very quick and very precise.There are 4 modes to keep you entertained.
neg,They're all basically the same.
nr,Quest is extremely hard to place in as the game has you do specific tasks like capturing 20 lions without capturing too many other animals.
pos,Time Attack is great for short 6 minute play sessions.
pos,The other two are marathon game types.The game also has single cart multiplayer aka DS Download Play. It's a fun experience though sometimes luck has a big hand in who wins.
nr,Luck because sometimes animals will just conveniently continue to line up as more animals fall from the top.
pos,It's definitely worth the $10 I got it for.
neg,Almost but not quite The game has a feel to it like CoV (the quest/mission instance's)but with out the quickness and fun.
neg,What I really didnt like about it was that the quests (the large ones) don't end with one dungeon.
neg,Allot of them have continuation's and a peep feels obligated to finish the whole series of quests in one go with the rest of his group (what i mean by that is not letting your friends down by dropping out befour its done).
neg,Even if it means being up till 6:00 when u halfta work the next morning at 8:00 or 9:00:( The game also takes a real long time to lvl in compareason with other morgs with a really low cap (I could get a char to lvl 15-20 or so in WOW in the time it would take me to get to lvl 2-4 in DDO. But I imagine i could get a couple of chars to lvl 10 in DDO in the time it would get a char in WOW to lvl 60) So it takes a while to get going in DDO where other MMORGS let u get some early lvls fairly easy to get u hooked(interested) Where as DDO u are a wimp for a long time whitch isnt fun.
neg,I think DDO will go the way of all turbine's other MMORG AC2 but allot quicker than AC2 did as AC2 was fun to play at least for a bit.
mix,Looks great to many bugs and to reliant on grouping (weak chars) only a couple chars can solo.
neg,All flash no substance Only get this game if you really really really love the trilogy.
mix,Not to be misconstrued I love the story of the one ring the hobbit is also very entertaining however this game is just a cheap and uninspired leech that gets all it's inspiration from the motion picture.
neg,I sat through hours and hours of the epic films (including the extended versions) the fragments they through in with this game are just how you say LAME!
neg,In summary I dislike it immensly also downloaded the demo for the second one.
nr,The demo for battle for middle earth two has more to it than this whole game.
nr,I might be considered a bit bias because in my experience I enjoy games in the 1st or 3rd person point of veiw a bit more.
neg,The 40 bucks I spent for this game is sorley missed refund is desired k thanks.
nr,Well I am a big fan of Western Shoot em up movies and...well...pretty much any shoot em up movie will do...One of my favorites was ''Last Man Standing''...Anyways to the game!
pos,Well I first got into this game in a PC Gamer magazine demo-disk....I thought it was fun and shelled out the $20 dollars for it...I loved every minute of the game!
pos,Graphics: 8/10 These graphics are just blocks piled ontop of eachother to present a character....But I guess in the time this came out...which was I believe '97.....these graphics still weren't top noch....Oh well...I don't judge games by graphics....Although...The cut scenes were fantastic!
pos,A nice western-cartoon feel!
nr,They bring the rating up from a six since the cut scenes don't last long.
pos,Story: 8/10 (same as pretty much any western type anything) You are a former marshal....Bad ass dude...Well a bunch of people want your land along with all the land surrounding you...You kept refusing so while you went to the store to pick up some supplies and your wife's perfume they murder your wife burn down your house and kidnap your kid!
pos,Well....You do what any badass ex-marshal would do; Go on a rampage and kill every one of those little Mutta Fu...nevermind....You just kill em all.
pos,Better than most FPS (exception; BLOOD!)
pos,Controls: 10/10 Your usual for a FPS.....You get your regular fire then a special fire which can make you shoot faster on some guns...you also got your open doors button...then your move buttons...and map...and jump...and so on.
pos,You really can't complain about the controls since you can modify them to your liking.
pos,Sounds and Music: 7/10 Well the sound is fantastic!
pos,The voices are done well!
pos,The gunshots are...near perfect.....there is even some villains that taunt you during the major killage which you inflict on the fiends....Then the music...Your very great western music!
nr,DUH!!! IT'S A FU...FREAKING WESTERN GAME!!!
neg,Though...After spending some time in a level with pretty much the same exact music it gets boring...and annoying...and after the whole game the same tracks are used in atleast four different levels...I think....Maybe it's the same track in every level...
pos,Originality: 9/10 It's been a while since there's been a western-like FPS...actually....I can't remember any other...Well there is probably another Western FPS I've played just this was the most memorable....
pos,In conclusion I give this game an 8/10....It's a really good game....seriously....The best western game I've ever played....It's got a nice story (for an fps) and all sorts of other junk...This is the game for any western shoot em up lover or just a regular action/FPS lover....Hell it's even good for people who aren't fans of the genr
pos,Revolutionary Halo was one of those games you cannot live without.
pos,It has such a rich campaign mode and the fact you can do co-op is a great feature.
pos,One of the best shooters of all time it is better on the Xbox than on the PC. Its graphics could have been a little bit better but it is still one of the best Xbox launch titles.
pos,I love the assault rifle and the magnum and it was disappointing to see no assault rifle in Halo 2. They also replaced the magnum with a crappier version that is too weak.
nr,I am awaiting Halo 3 and they showed Cheif holding the assault rifle which will be a great addition.
neg,I think in multiplayer you should be able to fly a pelican to drop of ammo and vehicles to your allies but if the other team shoots it down it will not spawn until the next match.
pos,If Final Fantasy VII is considered the pinnacle of console RPGs then Baldur's Gate is most definetely considered the pinnacle of computer RPGs. This is simply one of the best series of games ever made and any RPG fan simply cannot afford to not play it (and since the whole series is available for a tenner you don't exactly have an excuse not to do so!)
pos,Pros: -One of the best RPG series ever of all time for ten pounds.
pos,I haven't seen a bargain like that for a while.
pos,-Make your own unique character from scratch in Baldur's Gate 1 and then after completing the first game import them into Baldur's Gate 2 for true continuity and continue the saga.
pos,#NAME? with an epic storyline to match.
pos,#NAME? there are no restrictions in party members.
nr,Does your childhood friend Imoen annoy the hell out of you?
pos,Then dump her in the inn (or kill her if you are feeling particularly evil) and go off gallivanting with the Halfing pirate and insane necromancer instead!
pos,#NAME?
pos,-Choose your character's allignment (from 'goody-goody two shoes' to 'completely neutral' to 'murderous lunatic'.
pos,#NAME? every part of the series is just 1 DVD which creates a lot less hassle.
neg,Cons: -Despite the fact the game comes on DVDs you still can't avoid disk swapping at certain parts if you install all the expansions.
neg,For this reason I'd put off installing the expansions until you're at a point when you can make use of the expansion content (basically end-game or when you reach the experience-cap).
neg,#NAME? the good and evil aspect isn't exactly balanced.
neg,Generally the rewards for playing good are superior to taking an evil option (and sometimes there isn't a clear-cut evil option available at all).
neg,-Since Baldur's Gate 2 isn't able to check what characters are dead and alive during your playthrough of the first game if you play through both games you might find characters who you accidentally got beaten to death by a pack of gnolls being A-okay again (and the story of the second game also assumes you had a certain party-setup which you probably didn't).
pos,RPG fan or no you have no excuse not to play this incredible series.
pos,Edios's latest instalment to the Tomb Raider franchise is spectacular and one of this year's best games.
pos,Graphics - 9.5/10 Beautiful.
pos,From the glistening waterfalls to the detailed backgrounds to Lara herself everything is awsome.
pos,Attention to detail is astonishing from equipment appearing on Lara as you gain it to the smoke from her guns everything will leave you breathless.
mix,My only complaint is that lower end PCs cannot run next-gen graphics therefore reducing the beauty of it all Audio - 10/10 The game's background music although infrequent appears just at the right time.
pos,The beautiful ambiance will make you feel like you're actually in the game.
pos,And even the voice acting is well done with the occasional joke now and then.
pos,Good job Edios!
pos,Gameplay - 10/10 If you've played a previous Tomb Raider game then the outcome is predictable: jumping around shooting bad guys and the occasional puzzle and boss fight.
pos,It's the execution that makes this game shine.
pos,No stat-building no crappy jumps and NO camera issues.
nr,Jumping will soon become natural with the probability of barely making the ledge requiring you to quickly save Lara via the action button.
nr,Shimmying rolling and swinging will soon become second nature(or else!).
nr,Gun combat also had a massive overhaul requiring more strategy when engaging in combat.
nr,Enemies won't dodge attacks but are still a big threat.
nr,Dodging rolling and new slo-mo combat will aid you greatly.
pos,Some puzzles can be solved multiple ways allowing for a varied challenge depending on your gameplay style.
pos,Overall brilliant execution.
pos,Controls - 9/10 Although keyboard controls are a bit clunky a 10$ PS2-style gamepad will fix this right up.
pos,Story - 8.5/10 As before you have to raid tombs (hence the name) gaining the artifact inside.
pos,What sets this game apart from previous installments is the way it ties Lara's past into the mix allowing for a slowly unraveling plot to appear.
pos,Not spectacular but a damned fine effort Replay Value - 7/10 The game is quite short but the hidden artifacts and unlockables (and a time trial mode) allows for many a redo.
pos,Overall - 9/10 The Good-Graphics gameplay and audio will blow you away.
neg,The Bad-Low end PCs can't run next-gen graphics; slightly clunky keyboard controls The Hell?!-Early in the game you can hear the guards talking about a monkey smoking a cigarette.
pos,Weird. Buy or Rent-Buy. You'll want to keep this one for ages!
nr,A shinesprite56 review C 2006
pos,Innovative I played GC endlessly when it came out.
pos,Very addictive!
nr,There is a steep learning curve in this game which can only partly be compensated by starting off with weak enemies.
nr,"When you play against weak foes"" you will not really be """"tested."""""""
nr,You will just get an easier game.
neg,Also your diplomatic actions and nice foreign relations may or may not pay off so it is difficult to figure out a winning strategy.
neg,Just when you think you got it figured out you will get hit upside the head or start a game with tougher enemies that just kill you.
neg,"If you graduate to intelligent enemies"" the game is """"very challenging"""" aka painful."""""""
neg,You may win one out of ten tries.
neg,That can be discouraging; when you seem to be getting off to a good start only to have some aliens just stomp out your civilization with superior everything; and no help from your suppos
pos,The AI in this game is so strong and deeply complex that it can actually make you feel stupid which is probably not good for the gaming masses.
nr,Considering the fragile male ego I would think that most guys want to feel smarter than the game-in-the-box and would simply give up on this game.
nr,Girls are welcome to try of course!
nr,True strategy aficionados (and a few sado-masochists) will take this routine humiliation as a challenge and rack their brains to figure out a better way to play but ultimately a player's choices are limited--and sometimes you are simply doomed.
nr,One thing I can say for sure: If you get a bad starting location you will never overcome it no matter how hard you try.
neg,If you get bad position just START OVER. In fact let me file that one complaint: starting location in the galaxy (which seems fairly randomized) should not be such a profound determinant to the outcome.
nr,EARLY GAME STRATEGY TIPS Best starting politics is either pacifist or populist.
nr,Speed is a good primary enhancement plus diplomacy and influence.
nr,Speed is very useful at the beginning whereas influence and diplomacy have strong effects later on.
nr,You need to start in a location which is relatively unoccupied by potential enemies and land grab like crazy.
nr,This means 100% or 66% military spending (for colony ships) and zero social spending for 10 or 20 turns.
nr,Try to build a couple more survey ships for a quick boost to your stats and possible early attack capability.
nr,If you have a nearby competitor use your survey ships (if they procure attack capability a matter of luck) to wipe out colony ships and other survey ships to secure your sector of the galaxy.
nr,Early wars are soon forgotten and do not affect your alignment.
nr,"Usually the entire galaxy gets occupied quickly"" but sometimes there will be a """"backwater"""" of stars which is too far from all comers for direct colonization."""
nr,The secret is to build a space station (or a chain of them) to bridge the gap and get your colonists over there.
nr,That backwater is likely the safest location in the game.
nr,Once established you have to adapt your strategy depending on your relative location and alignment.
pos,GC is an amazingly difficult game!
pos,I am looking forward to trying out GC2 but from the reviews it seems that the major enhancement is the ability to design ships.
nr,"I don't think I want to pay $40 for that ""privilege."""
pos,Just plain fun I don't see why this game got a lower score than the other Nintendogs.
nr,I fail to see the new flaws to it that make it worse.
nr,Story: You are a person looking for a dog so you go to the local kennel and pick out your new best virtual friend!
nr,After that there is no real story to it so I'm not going to rate it upon story.
nr,Difficulty: That actually depends upon the dog that you pick out and it's personality.
nr,If it says that it is calm or something like that it would be like to easy difficulty but if he is naughty and needed lots of training it would be the hard difficulty.
pos,It's like the teams in Sonic Heroes only the system works better.
pos,8.5/10 Graphics: The graphics almost look lifelike.
pos,The mouth physics on the dog work perfectly the dog's body animations feel perfect.
pos,I also haven't encountered any drops in the game's frame rate.
pos,10/10 Controls: You'll find yourself mostly using the stylus for this game by throwing things rubbing your stylus on your dog's head to pet them and showing them how to do tricks.
pos,10/10 Overall I don't see why this game got a lower score than the others.
pos,It's just as fun.
nr,I don't think people should dock it points because it's the same game.
nr,The second game that was released wasn't docked any points.
nr,Why's that?
pos,9/10. Great Job!
nr,mixed reactions Kingdom Hearts... my second favourite PS2 game...
nr,KH: Chain of Memories...
mix,a good game but not what i expected...
pos,Story The plot is what really kept me fromlosing hope of this game.
nr,The story continues from Kingdom Hearts. Sora Donald and Goofy just found Pluto running with a letter.
pos,The intro has PS2 graphics!
nr,They find a man in a black cloak who leads him to Castle Oblivian.
nr,He gets cards that takes him to different worlds.
neg,"The story is really the same as KH"" but they replace """"heart"""" with memory."""
nr,Do you remember in KH Queen of Hearts from Alice in Wonderland accused her because she thought Alice Attempted to steal her heart?
nr,In this Queen think the tried to steal her memory.
nr,Other than that they introduce new characters.
nr,And when you finish the game you unlock a new mode which lets you play as Riku with a different story about Riku's darkness.
neg,Gameplay The gameplay in battles are weird!!
nr,But to get into a battle you see heartles walk around if they touch you you enter the battle you can hit them with your Keyblade to stun the enemies when you enter (Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga?).
nr,Well in-battle heartles surround you and you battle you have cards depending on your attack.
nr,Each card has a number depending you strong it is.
nr,When you opponents attack you see wat card they use and then you can use your card if your card's number is higher you can break the opponents card a 0 breaks anything but could be as easily broken by something higher.
nr,You can 3 cards so you use them at once or use a special attack (so if you stock 3 keyblades Sora does his 3 hit combo.
pos,If you stock 3 Fire cards you unleash Firaga. Graphics Graphics are pretty good.
pos,In KH do you know when you start the opening scene looks AWESOME and realistic and the same for the end?
pos,IN this game the Opening scene has the normal cutscene graphics as KH same as the end.
pos,The normal graphics are good too.
pos,Sound Sound... I LOVE THE KH MUSIC!
pos,This is good too!!
pos,They do Simple & Clean at the end!
pos,The sound is terrific.
nr,Playtime This game could last...
nr,after you finish Sora's mode you get Riku's mode.
pos,Score 8.9
pos,Instant classic SSX 3 lets you play one of eight characters.
pos,You can customize this character in many outrageous ways.
pos,You can customize hair snowboard suit boots shirts and much more.
pos,Also you can buy new tricks.
pos,The graphs are very very good for good 'ol Xbox. You really have the feeling that you self are snowboarding on top of that big fat mountain.
pos,SSX 3 gives you a huge amount of freedom because you can explore the mountain all by yourself and there are no linear routes that you have to take.
pos,You decide which tournament you want to play and where you wanna do that.
pos,It's your choice.
pos,The gameplay is very very good.
pos,You can unlock every tournament there is and still you are not finished.
pos,You also have to beat rivals explore the mountain complete every extra bonus missions and collect stickers drawings and dolls of the characters.
pos,There is so much too do.
pos,It just won;t bore you.
pos,GET SSX 3! That's my only conclusion if you don't have this game in your collection get it now while it's still there and go and shame yourself!!!
pos,NG2 doesn't disapoint!
pos,It gets you strait where the first game left you - right into the action!
pos,I'm still on the first level but so far I can yell: THERE IS NO ANY PROBLEM WITH THE CAMERA!
pos,It is just perfect!
pos,Not only you have the old lock behind the Ryo button but now you have total control over camera movement with the right stick (and you can adjust the speed of it at any time).
pos,The frame rate is stable even through the pace of the game is considarably faster and there are more enemies on your ass at the same time.
pos,I didn't experience any slow downs or others issues.
pos,So far so good I'm as excited as anyone who has played the previous Itakagi is my man too bad he is leaving Tecmo but maybe its a good thing since I doubt he will stop making games...
nr,Best in series Anyone who buys a game with the EA logo on it should always expect that game to have a few issues; especially with something that they release every year like sports.
nr,Sometimes the production deadlines must get in the way of perfecting the game mechanics because time and time again EA is guilty of this developer sin.
nr,I'm talking mostly about online issues here such as occasional but crippling lag a camera that gets stuck from time to time...
nr,It really kills the experience when a close game is ripped from your hands because the software failed to live up to its end of the bargain.
pos,That being said NBA Live 10 is fan-freakin-tastic!
pos,The basketball mechanics are solid almost perfect.
pos,You really feel like you have total control over the player and each superstar plays distinctively different.
pos,The DNA option which updates rosters and player ratings/tendencies to reflect real life NBA performance is superb and it really feels like you're playing in the NBA. If you want a great online sports game grab this just don't expect EA to get everything right.
